 Best July 4th deals deliver on Apple’s latest |

What better discount to take the July 4th spotlight than the best price yet on Apple’s all-new 15-inch M2 MacBook Air. Already becoming one of the most popular macOS machines on the market, the new release just hit store shelves last month. It’s now having some savings applied, with the $100 discount delivering the 15.3-inch Retina display and M2 chip for the all-time low of $1,199. Many writers and editors here at 9to5 have already made the switch, and now you can too without paying full price.

The Apple savings today also carry over to largely every other corner of the lineup. We’re tracking the best prices of the year for July 4th on the entire AirPods lineup, the latest Apple Watch wearables, and so much more down below. The second-best price of the year on Apple Pencil 2 is certainly worth a closer look at $89 before we get to the rest of the savings, too.
